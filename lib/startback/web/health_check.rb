module Startback
  module Web
    #
    # Can be used to easily implement a HealthCheck web service inside a Startback
    # application.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #     # Returns a 204 with no body
    #     run Startback::HealthCheck.new
    #
    #     # Returns a 204 with no body
    #     run Startback::HealthCheck.new { nil }
    #
    #     # Returns a 200 with Ok in plain text
    #     run Startback::HealthCheck.new { "Ok" }
    #
    #     # Re-raises the exception
    #     run Startback::HealthCheck.new { raise "Something bad" }
    #
    # Please note that this rack app is not 100% Rack compliant, since it raises
    # any error that the block itself raises. This class aims at being backed up
    # by a Shield and/or CatchAll middleware.
    #
    # This class is not aimed at being subclassed.
    #
    class HealthCheck
